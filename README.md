# Recipe Tracking App Using React
A mock recipe-tracking CRUD app interface with a focus on rendering and state management using React.

This project was a great way to practice the following:
  - utilizing the useState() hook
  - lifting up state through a component tree
  - handling events
  - creating a form and storing state inside a form object
  - using the single-responsibility principle for React components

The user can create a new recipe, view a list of existing recipes and delete a recipe.
Data is displayed in a table.
